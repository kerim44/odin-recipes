        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water,
                mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form
                a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a
                bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground
                beef, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon
                until mashed. Set filling aside.
            </li>
            <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>
            <li>
                Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll
                dough on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you
                can. Cut into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place about 2 teaspoons meat filling in the center of each
                square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the
                top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate;
                sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat
                just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat
                and keep warm. Stir together yogurt and minced garlic in a small
                bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high
                heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer
                pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and
                drizzle each serving with warm red pepper oil.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tip</h2>
        <p>
            You can use ground lamb or other ground meat in place of the beef,
            if you prefer.
